abstract="Trusted open data can be used for auditing, accountability, business development, or as an anti-corruption mechanism. Metadata information can address provenance concerns, and trust issues can somehow be mitigated by digital signatures. Those approaches can trace the data origin, but usually lack information about the transformation process. Creating trust in an open data service through technology can reduce the need for third-party certifications, and creating a distributed consensus mechanism capable of validating all the transformations can guarantee that the datasets are reliable and easy to use. This work aims to leverage blockchain technologies to track open data transformations, allowing consumers to verify the data using a distributed ledger, and providing a mechanism capable of publishing trusted transformed data without relying on third-party certifications. To validate the proposed approach, use cases for data transformation will be used. The consensus protocol must be capable of validating the transformations according to a predefined algorithm, the provider must be capable of publishing verifiable transformed data, and the consumer should be able to check if a dataset originated by a transformation is legit.",

abstract = "Billions of Linked Data triples exist in thousands of RDF knowledge graphs on the Web, but few of those graphs can be queried live from Web applications. Only a limited number of knowledge graphs are available in a queryable interface, and existing interfaces can be expensive to host at high availability. To mitigate this shortage of live queryable Linked Data, we designed a low-cost Triple Pattern Fragments interface for servers, and a client-side algorithm that evaluates SPARQL queries against this interface. This article describes the Linked Data Fragments framework to analyze Web interfaces to Linked Data and uses this framework as a basis to define Triple Pattern Fragments. We describe client-side querying for single knowledge graphs and federations thereof. Our evaluation verifies that this technique reduces server load and increases caching effectiveness, which leads to lower costs to maintain high server availability. These benefits come at the expense of increased bandwidth and slower, but more stable query execution times. These results substantiate the claim that lightweight interfaces can lower the cost for knowledge publishers compared to more expressive endpoints, while enabling applications to query the publishers’ data with the necessary reliability."

@article{amorimComparison2017,
	Abstract = {Research data management is rapidly becoming a regular concern for researchers, and institutions need to provide them with platforms to support data organization and preparation for publication. Some institutions have adopted institutional repositories as the basis for data deposit, whereas others are experimenting with richer environments for data description, in spite of the diversity of existing workflows. This paper is a synthetic overview of current platforms that can be used for data management purposes. Adopting a pragmatic view on data management, the paper focuses on solutions that can be adopted in the long tail of science, where investments in tools and manpower are modest. First, a broad set of data management platforms is presented---some designed for institutional repositories and digital libraries---to select a short list of the more promising ones for data management. These platforms are compared considering their architecture, support for metadata, existing programming interfaces, as well as their search mechanisms and community acceptance. In this process, the stakeholders'requirements are also taken into account. The results show that there is still plenty of room for improvement, mainly regarding the specificity of data description in different domains, as well as the potential for integration of the data management platforms with existing research management tools. Nevertheless, depending on the context, some platforms can meet all or part of the stakeholders'requirements.},
