Information;;;;
"The information in this comparative review of open access data repositories was compiled by Derek Murphy and Julian Gautier to inform product development for the Dataverse Project at the Harvard Institute for Quantitative Social Science.

We chose to look at repositories rather than platforms, which helps us evaluate repositories from a researcherâ€™s perspective. Therefore, we may miss features that the platform is capable of if the repository using that platform has not implemented those features.

To recommend other repositories that the community can benefit from comparing, please leave a comment on the ""Comparative review of data repositories"" tab or email juliangautier@g.harvard.edu.
