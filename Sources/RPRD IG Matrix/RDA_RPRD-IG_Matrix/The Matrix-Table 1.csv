Persistent identifiers;Assignment of PID / DOI ;At data ingest time or “project publication” or even before (e.g. when a paper was submitted but the data are not final yet) a PID has to be assigned to data and the collections it belongs to. It resolves to the “landing page” of the research data, which displays the required descriptive metadata during the embargo period. A clear transition for PID collections to a DOI has to be established.;26;1,33;7;2;;1;2;;1;;1;;1;1;

Data Access;Sophisticated search capabilities for metadata and data both for humans and computers;Allow search capabilities like full text search, schema specific search.

Integration;Federation;Enable interoperation with other existing data management systems;8;1,00;2;;1;;;;;;;;;1;
Persistent identifiers;Integration of PIDs into data management ;All data management activities should be integrated with PID management. PID metadata has to always be in sync with the data/metadata holding.;8;1,00;2;;;1;;;;;;;1;;
Policy Support;Require all data to be attributed with handling requirements;Handling requirements include licenses and security parameters.;8;1,00;2;;;;;1;;;1;;;;
